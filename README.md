<h1>Saudi UNO PCB Project</h1>
<p>This repository hosts the PCB design files for the Saudi UNO, an Arduino UNO-compatible device designed in the shape of the Saudi map. It's intended primarily for educational use in electronics and microcontroller programming.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The Saudi UNO is a unique Arduino UNO variant, customized to reflect the geographic outline of Saudi Arabia. It serves as an educational tool to engage students in learning about electronics design and practical PCB layout techniques.</p>

<h2>Files Included</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Gerber Files:</strong> Contains all necessary manufacturing data for the PCB.</li>
    <li><strong>Schematic Files:</strong> Electronic schematics detailing component placement and connections.</li>
    <li><strong>Assembly Drawings:</strong> Helpful for visualizing component placement during the soldering process.</li>
    <li><strong>Bill of Materials (BOM):</strong> A comprehensive list of all components required to build the Saudi UNO.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>To use these files:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Download the desired files from the repository.</li>
    <li>Contact a PCB manufacturer and provide them with the Gerber files for production.</li>
    <li>Refer to the assembly drawings and BOM for assembling the PCB once manufactured.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>You will need access to PCB manufacturing services and basic soldering tools to assemble the board. Familiarity with electronic components and soldering is recommended.</p>
